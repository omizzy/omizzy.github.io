> Soap is the dirt we buy. We introduce it to the dirt we have, and the two dirts are so glad to see each other they come out and mix!<br/>They swim together in the warm pleasurable water and, at just the right moment, the washer lifts the cloth of our true being free of both soap and dirt.<br/>Mystical poetry and other practices may function this way, as soap that dances with what disturbs our **clarity**. Then at some moment they drop away and leave us **clean, ready** to be worn again.

Excerpt from **On the Unseen** by Coleman Barks
