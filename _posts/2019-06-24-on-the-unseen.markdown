> Soap is the dirt we buy.<br/>
We introduce it to the dirt we have,<br/>
and the two dirts are so glad to see each other they come out and mix!<br/>
They swim together in the warm pleasurable water and,<br/>
at just the right moment,<br/>
the washer lifts the cloth of our true being free of both soap and dirt.
<br/>Mystical poetry and other practices may function this way,
<br/>as soap that dances with what disturbs our **clarity**.<br/>
Then at some moment they drop away and leave us **clean, ready** to be worn again.

Excerpt from **On the Unseen** by Coleman Barks
