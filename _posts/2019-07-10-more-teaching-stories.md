> Nothing can be clear without a polar opposite present.

> The snake is your animal-soul. When you bring it<br/>
into the hot air of your wanting-energy, warmed<br/>
by that and by the prospect of power and wealth,<br/>
it does massive damage.<br/>

> World-power means nothing. Only the unsayable,<br/>
jeweled inner life matters.

&#151; Rumi
