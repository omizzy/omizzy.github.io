> What is the mirror of being?<br/>
Non-being.<br/>
Always bring a mirror of non-existence as a gift.<br/>
Any other present is foolish.<br/><br/>
Let the poor man look deep into generosity.<br/>
Let bread see a hungry man.<br/>
Let kindling behold a spark from the flint.<br/><br/>
An empty mirror and your worst destructive habits,<br/>
when they are held up to each other,<br/>
that's when the real making begins.<br/>
That's what art and crafting are.<br/><br/>
A tailor needs a torn garment to practice his expertise.<br/>
The trunks of trees must be cut and cut again<br/>
so they can be used for carpentry.<br/><br/>
Your doctor must have a broken leg to doctor.<br/>
Your defects are the ways that glory gets manifested.<br/>
Whoever sees clearly what's diseased in himself<br/>
begins to gallop on the way.<br/><br/>
There is nothing worse<br/>
Than thinking you are well enough.<br/>
More than anything, self-complacency<br/>
Blocks the workmanship.<br/><br/>
Put your vileness up to a mirror and weep.<br/>
Get that self-satisfaction flowing out of you!<br/>
Satan thought, "I am better than Adam"<br/>
And that "better than" is still strongly in us.<br/><br/>
Your stream water may look clean,<br/>
But there's unstirred matter on the bottom.<br/>
Your sheikh can dig a side channel<br/>
That will drain that waste off.<br/><br/>
Trust your wound to a teacher's surgery.<br/>
Flies collect on a wound. They cover it,<br/>
Those flies of your self-protecting feelings,<br/>
Your love for what you think is yours.<br/><br/>
Let a teacher wave away the flies<br/>
And put a plaster on the wound.<br/><br/>
Don't turn your head.<br/>
Keep looking At the bandaged place.<br/>
That's where the light enters you.
And don't believe for a moment<br/>
That you're healing yourself.

Excerpt from **Childhood Friends** By Rumi
